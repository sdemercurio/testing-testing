                <p>Tim is a Certified Coactive Professional Coach (CCPC) as well as an Associate Certified Coach (ACC)
                  within the
                  International Coaching Federation. His coaching clientele are emerging and established leaders, start
                  up entrepreneurs,
                  and professionals seeking to broaden their capacity in order to scale. </p>
                </br>
                <p>Coaching has been the common thread in Tim’s professional career. After playing basketball at the
                  collegiate level for four years,
                  Tim volunteered as a high school assistant coach while working as a pharmaceutical sales rep at Eli
                  Lilly and Company. This experience
                  sparked a passion to coach and help teenagers develop into confident young adults. The dream of
                  “coaching for a living” was born through
                  that experience, and culminated in the launch of 40 Watt Coaching in 2021. </p>
                </br>
                <p>Tim started his career in training and coaching professionally in 2015 at the global communication
                  training company Own The Room.
                  Over 4 years, Tim coached thousands of individuals around the world in a wide variety of seniority
                  levels, organizations and job
                  functions. In 2016 he led the company’s growth and expansion into the San Francisco Bay Area,
                  establishing its first U.S. West Coast
                  operation and building a team from scratch.</p>
                </br>
                <p>In 2019, Tim joined the fintech company Stripe in San Francisco to lead Manager and Leadership
                  Enablement on their Organizational
                  Development team. In this role, Tim was responsible for building and executing programs that increased
                  skill level, managerial
                  capacity, and inspired mindset growth for leaders at the company.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tim’s career began in pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical diagnostic sales, where he spent a decade
                  as an award winning sales
                  professional. He then spent 4 years in higher education advancement as a major gift fundraiser at the
                  University of Michigan.</p>

                and
                kind with the feedback he gives in workshops. Our partnership at Facebook extended well beyond typical
                training offerings and shifted into customized workshops based on data that we collected from our team.
                Tim
                is forward thinking, innovative and always willing to try and pilot new things. He's been an integral
                partner for us. I highly recommend Tim if you have the chance to work with him.”</p>

                Tim
                Fortescue as our pitch mentor. In a few short sessions, Tim empowered the entire cohort with an
                actionable
